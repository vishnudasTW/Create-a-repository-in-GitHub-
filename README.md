# Create a repository in GitHub 

## Introduction  

Using GitHub, you can create repositories to store and organize your code, documentation, and project related files. You can easily manage, collaborate and share your codes and files using the repositories. GitHub repositories offer a centralized location for teams to work on a project together, track changes and contributions, and share the work with the wider community.

In this document, you will learn how to create a repository using your GitHub account.

**Note:** If you do not have a GitHub account, you must create one. For more information refer: [Signing up for a new GitHub account](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/signing-up-for-github/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account)
